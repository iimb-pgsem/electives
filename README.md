A course elective preference collection and allocation system built for
the Post-Graduate Program in Software Enterprise Management (PGSEM) at
the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore (IIM-B).

Students submit prioritized course preferences through a web interface.
The allocation engine then assigns courses using a multi-factor ranking
algorithm that considers seniority, course priority, and CGPA.

## History

This system was developed in 2006-2007 and used for multiple quarterly
allocation cycles (Q4 2005 through Q4 2006). The original version
control was CVS; this repository was reconstructed from those CVS
archives in 2026 with proper commit history, conventional commit
messages, and PII removed.

| `pgsem-schema.sql` | MySQL database schema (authcode, choices, changes, log) |

## Allocation Algorithm

The system uses a three-phase allocation process:

### Phase 1: Demand Collection
Students submit the number of courses they plan to take and a prioritized
list of preferences (non-binding). This data is used to schedule classes
and minimize conflicts.

### Phase 2: Allocation (2A + 2B)
Students submit binding preferences. The engine allocates courses based on:

1. **Seniority** (`older_and_lazy_rule`): Earlier batch students who haven't
   completed >=93 credits get priority. Students who missed Phase 1 or
   Phase 2A lose seniority.
2. **Course priority**: Within a seniority bucket, students who ranked a
   course higher get priority.
3. **CGPA**: Tie-breaker within the same seniority and priority level.
4. **Roll number**: Final tie-breaker (lower roll number wins).

A student gets a course unless:
- They've been allocated all courses they requested
- Their CGPA limits them (< 2.75 → max 3 courses; < 2.75 with project → max 2)
- A higher-priority course was already allocated in the same time slot
- The course reached its capacity cap

### Phase 3: Add/Drop/Swap
Students can request to add, drop, or swap courses subject to capacity
and schedule constraints.

## Data Formats

All data files use semicolon-delimited fields. Lines starting with `#`
are comments; blank lines are skipped.

### courses.txt
```
# code; name; instructor; cap; slot; status; site; barred
CS101; Data Structures; Prof. Sharma; 60; 1; A; B;
FIN201; Corporate Finance; Prof. Rao; 50; 2; A; B+C;
```
- **status**: `A` (active), `D` (dropped), `N` (not available)
- **site**: `B` (Bangalore), `C` (Chennai), `B+C` (distributed)
- **barred**: year (e.g., `2005`) — batch barred from this course

### students.txt
```
# rollno; name; email; cgpa; credits; site
2004101; Student Name; student@example.com; 3.45; 72; B
```

### choices.txt
```
# rollno; ncourses; comma-separated-courses (priority order)
2004101; 3; CS101,FIN201,MKT301
```
Note: the course list is **comma-separated** within the third semicolon-delimited field.

### project_students.txt
```
# one roll number per line

2004110
```

## Running the Allocation Engine

### Prerequisites
- Perl 5.x with modules: `DBI`, `Spreadsheet::WriteExcel`, `POSIX`
- MySQL (for the web interface; not required for batch allocation)

### Batch allocation (no database required)

```bash
cd test/
PERL5LIB=.. perl ../elec.pl
```

This reads from the current directory:
- `config.txt` — allocation parameters
- `courses-internal.txt` — course catalog (internal format with single-site rows)
- `students.txt` — student roster
- `choices.txt` — submitted preferences
- `project-students.txt` — students doing projects
- `choices-p1.txt` — Phase 1 participant roll numbers
- `p2a-students.txt`, `p2-students.txt` — Phase 2 participant lists

Output goes to stdout and `allocation-internal.txt`. An Excel workbook
(`allocation.xls`) is also generated if `Spreadsheet::WriteExcel` is
installed.

### Web interface

1. Create the MySQL database: `mysql < pgsem-schema.sql`
2. Configure `config.txt` with database credentials
3. Deploy CGI scripts to a web server with CGI support
4. Access `electives.cgi` through the browser

## Testing

The project includes a CI pipeline ([GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/ci.yml))
and a complete set of synthetic test fixtures in `test/`.

### Test fixtures

The `test/` directory contains everything needed to run the allocation
engine without a database: 10 courses, 21 synthetic students across
3 batches (2003–2005), and realistic preference data. The data is
designed to exercise:

- **Seniority ranking**: 2003 batch students are allocated before 2004,
  then 2005
- **Seniority loss**: student 2003106 has >=93 credits and loses
  seniority privilege
- **Schedule conflict detection**: courses sharing the same time slot
  cannot both be allocated to one student
- **CGPA-based tie-breaking**: within the same seniority and priority
- **Project student handling**: project students get one fewer elective
  slot

### CI pipeline

On every push and pull request, CI runs three checks:

1. **Syntax check** — `perl -c` on all `.pl`, `.pm`, and `.cgi` files
2. **Allocation test** — runs the engine against test fixtures and
   verifies allotments, course/student output sections, seniority
   ordering, schedule conflict detection, and Excel workbook generation
3. **PII scan** — ensures no student email addresses or data files are
   present in the repository
